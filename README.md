# LeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from the LeetCode platform. LeetCode is a popular website where you can practice coding skills by solving algorithmic problems across a wide range of difficulty levels.

## About LeetCode

LeetCode offers a vast collection of coding problems categorized into different topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, sorting, searching, and many more. Each problem provides a description, example test cases, and constraints. The goal is to solve the problem efficiently and correctly within the given constraints.

## Repository Structure

- **Each Problem**: Each problem solution is organized into its own directory, named after the problem's ID and title.
- **Solution Files**: Within each problem directory, you'll find the solution file(s) containing the code written in Java.
- **README**: Each problem directory also includes a README file providing a brief description of the problem and any additional notes about the solution.

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is a valuable resource for honing algorithmic problem-solving skills, preparing for technical interviews, and improving coding proficiency. By solving LeetCode problems, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities, learn new algorithms and data structures, and become more proficient in writing efficient and clean code.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the solutions provided in this repository are my own work and may not always be the most optimal or elegant solutions. I encourage you to explore different approaches and optimize the solutions further. Additionally, refrain from directly copying solutions for interview purposes; instead, use them as a reference to understand the problem-solving approach.
